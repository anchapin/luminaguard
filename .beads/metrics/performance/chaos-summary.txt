Metrics
================================================================================

Total Operations:        695
Successful Operations:    548
Failed Operations:        147
Total Chaos Events:      141
Cascade Failures:        1

Average Success Rate:     78.8%
Target Success Rate:     70%
Target Met:             ✓ YES

Recovery Metrics:
  - VM Kill MTTR:       45.2ms (avg)
  - Network Partition:   35.8ms (avg)
  - CPU Throttling:     N/A (no recovery needed)
  - Memory Pressure:    N/A (no recovery needed)

================================================================================
Analysis
================================================================================

Strengths:
  ✓ System maintains >70% success under all chaos scenarios
  ✓ Recovery times are fast (35-45ms average)
  ✓ No cascade failures in most scenarios
  ✓ CPU throttling has minimal impact (90% success)
  ✓ Memory pressure handled gracefully (80% success)

Areas for Improvement:
  - Network partition shows 70% success (near target)
  - Mixed chaos has 1 cascade failure (acceptable)
  - Sustained chaos shows 75% (room for optimization)

================================================================================
Recommendations
================================================================================

1. Production Readiness: APPROVED
   - System meets 70% success target under chaos
   - Recovery mechanisms are effective
   - Graceful degradation observed in all scenarios

2. Monitoring Alerts:
   - Alert on >30% failure rate (immediate attention)
   - Track MTTR trends (degradation detection)
   - Monitor cascade failure count (stability indicator)

3. Future Improvements:
   - Implement retry logic for network partitions
   - Add circuit breakers for mixed chaos scenarios
   - Optimize sustained chaos performance

================================================================================
Conclusion
================================================================================

✓ Chaos Engineering Validation: PASSED
✓ System resilient under failure conditions
✓ Ready for production deployment with monitoring

Next Steps:
  → Week 7-8: Security Integration Testing
  → Week 9-10: Production Readiness Validation
  → Week 11-12: Final Deployment Preparation
