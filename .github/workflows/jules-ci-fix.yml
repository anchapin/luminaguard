            The CI workflow "${{ github.event.workflow_run.name }}" has failed.

            **Failed Run:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}
            **Branch:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
            **Commit:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}

            Please:
            1. Analyze the failure from the workflow run
            2. Identify the root cause
            3. Implement a fix

            **IronClaw Context:**
            - This is a Rust + Python monorepo
            - Rust code is in `orchestrator/`
            - Python code is in `agent/`
            - Tests run via `make test`
            - Pre-commit hooks enforce quality (formatting, linting, coverage)

            **Constraints:**
            - Must pass `make test`
            - Must respect pre-commit hooks (run `make fmt` before committing)
            - loop.py must stay under 4,000 lines
            - Coverage must not decrease (see .coverage-baseline.json)

            **Approval Cliff (Red Actions):**
            - Editing code, deleting files requires approval
            - Run tests to verify fixes before creating PR
