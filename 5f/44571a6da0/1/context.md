# PR Swarmit - Parallel PR Investigation and Fixing with Git Worktrees

Uses a swarm of sub-agents and git worktrees to systematically investigate, fix (if necessary), and prepare open PRs for merging. This approach allows parallel processing of multiple PRs without interference.

## Core Philosophy

1. **No Bypasses**: Never use labels, skips, or disabling checks to "fix" CI failures
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Find and fix t...

<result>The CI runs are all from earlier today. My latest push (commit 7e470a2) hasn't triggered a new CI run yet. This is because:
