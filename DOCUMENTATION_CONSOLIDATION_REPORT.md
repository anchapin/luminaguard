# Documentation Consolidation Report - Issue #242

## Review Summary

Reviewed documentation files between root directory and `docs/` subdirectory to identify potential duplicates.

## Root Directory Files

The following files remain in the root directory and are essential project files:

- **AGENTS.md** - AI agent instructions for the project
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI agent context and guidance
- **README.md** - Project README
- **luminaguard_prd.md** - Product Requirements Document
- **ROOTFS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Technical reference for rootfs

These files serve as essential project metadata and should remain in the root directory.

## docs/ Directory

The `docs/` directory contains organized project documentation:
- `docs/architecture/` - Architectural documentation
- `docs/security/` - Security documentation  
- `docs/testing/` - Testing documentation
- `docs/validation/` - Validation documentation
- `docs/reviews/` - PR review documentation
- Various markdown files on specific topics

## Conclusion

**No duplicates found.** The root directory contains essential project metadata files that should remain in the root, while the `docs/` directory contains organized topic-specific documentation.

The AI-generated temporary files (previously cluttering the root) have been addressed in Issue #239.
