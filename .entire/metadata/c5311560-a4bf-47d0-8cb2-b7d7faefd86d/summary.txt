Fixed. The issue was on line 28 - the `jq` expression had `else "UNKNOWN" end` without a proper `if...then` structure. In `jq`, conditional expressions must be complete: `if...then...else...end`.

**What I changed:**
- Rewrote the `jq` query with proper `if...then...elif...else...end` syntax
- Added logic to aggregate multiple check runs and return the worst status (FAIL > RUNNING > SUCCESS > UNKNOWN)

**To apply the fix:** Since the background process is already running with the old script, you'll need to restart it:

```bash
# Stop the old process
kill $(cat /tmp/ironclaw-auto-merge.pid)
rm /tmp/ironclaw-auto-merge.pid

# Start with the fixed script
./scripts/start-auto-merge.sh
```
