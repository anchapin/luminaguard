## FPF Status Report

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Current Phase** | `IDLE` |
| **Active Role** | None |
| **Evidence Freshness** | All holons FRESH ✓ |

### Hypothesis Counts

| Layer | Count | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **L0** (Proposed) | 22 hypotheses | Core design decisions + alternatives |
| **L1** (Verified) | 11 hypotheses | Logic verification completed |
| **L2** (Validated) | 10 hypotheses | Empirical validation completed |

### Summary

The FPF cycle is currently in `IDLE` state. All evidence is fresh with no decay warnings. The knowledge base contains a healthy distribution across all three layers:

- **L0**: Initial proposals covering MCP client, JIT VM spawning, reasoning engines, repository health, and RPC architecture
- **L1**: Verified hypotheses with logic checks completed
- **L2**: Validated hypotheses with empirical testing and audit records

### Available Actions

- `/q0-init` - Initialize a new FPF context
- `/q1-add` - Inject a user hypothesis
- `/q1-hypothesize` - Generate hypotheses (abduction)
- `/q2-verify` - Verify logic (deduction)
- `/q3-validate` - Validate (induction)
- `/q4-audit` - Audit evidence (trust calculus)
- `/q5-decide` - Finalize decision (DRR)
