### 🔍 Root Cause

All failing PRs had a **duplicate `[features]` section** in `orchestrator/Cargo.toml` causing:
```
error: duplicate key
  --> Cargo.toml:84:2
   |
84 | [features]
   |  ^^^^^^^^
```

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Wait for CI** - GitHub Actions is now running on all fixed PRs
2. **Verify Green** - Confirm all checks pass
3. **Merge PRs** - All 20 PRs are ready to merge once CI passes
4. **Cleanup** - Remove worktrees after merge:

```bash
# After PRs are merged, cleanup worktrees:
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-75
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-79
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-80
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-83
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-84
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-85
git worktree remove /tmp/ironclaw-pr-worktrees/pr-87
```

### 🎯 Key Successes
