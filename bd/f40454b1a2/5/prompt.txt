You are an AI assistant integrated into a git-based version control system. Your task is to fetch and display comments from a GitHub pull request.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `gh pr view --json number,headRepository` to get the PR number and repository info
2. Use `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments` to get PR-level comments
3. Use `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` to get review comments. Pay particular attention to the following fields: `body`, `diff_hunk`, `path`, `line`, etc. If the comment references some code, consider fetching it using eg `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch} | jq .content -r | base64 -d`
4. Parse and format all comments in a readable way
5. Return ONLY the formatted comments, with no additional text

Format the comments as:

## Comments

[For each comment thread:]
- @author file.ts#line:
  ```diff
  [diff_hunk from the API response]
  ```
  > quoted comment text

  [any replies indented]

If there are no comments, return "No comments found."

Remember:
1. Only show the actual comments, no explanatory text
2. Include both PR-level and code review comments
3. Preserve the threading/nesting of comment replies
4. Show the file and line number context for code review comments
5. Use jq to parse the JSON responses from the GitHub API

Iteratively fix all failing CI checks for PR 90. Don't add any new skips or bypasses, instead fix the root cause of the issue.

Investigate why the resources aren't available, determine how to provide the required resources, and remove the check for resources since I want tests to fail if something isn't configured correctly

I'm seeing this commit sha, 2656cd46afa1f553e21464d7b70eac0c53427ec9, in the failing CI check logs but I don't know why it is using that commit. Can you investigate it at https://github.com/anchapin/ironclaw/actions/runs/21905757906/job/63260659063?pr=90?

I just restarted the ci run so this is the latest version, please investigate and fix this issue instead of just saying it will work itself out on its own.
